# Benchmarking in Java

Benchmarking is an essential technique to measure the performance of code snippets, identify bottlenecks, and compare different implementations. In Java, you can use simple approaches like `System.nanoTime()` or specialized frameworks like JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness).

## Basic Concepts

Benchmarking measures the execution time or resource usage of an operation to understand its performance. Itâ€™s crucial for optimizations and technical decisions.

---

## Measuring with System.nanoTime()

The most used method for measuring short times, with high resolution.

```java
long start = System.nanoTime();
// code to measure
long end = System.nanoTime();
System.out.println("Time: " + (end - start) + " ns");
```

---

## Measuring with System.currentTimeMillis()

Useful for longer operations, measuring time in milliseconds.

```java
long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
// code to measure
long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
System.out.println("Time: " + (end - start) + " ms");
```

---

## Creating Generic Benchmark Methods

Encapsulating measurement facilitates reuse and organization.

```java
public static void benchmark(Runnable task, String name) {
    long start = System.nanoTime();
    task.run();
    long end = System.nanoTime();
    System.out.println(name + " took " + (end - start) / 1_000_000 + " ms");
}
```

## Introduction to JMH

JMH is the official framework for microbenchmarks in Java. It handles warm-up, JVM optimizations, and precise data collection.

- Supports multiple modes (Throughput, Latency, etc.)
- Uses annotations to define benchmarks
- Integrates with Maven/Gradle

---

## Tips for Reliable Benchmarks

- Run multiple iterations and use averages
- Include warm-up runs so JVM can optimize code
- Avoid interference from Garbage Collector
- Clearly separate measured code from setup/other code
- Use specialized tools for complex benchmarks (e.g., JMH)
