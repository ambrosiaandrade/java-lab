Java `record` is a special kind of class introduced in Java 14 (preview) and officially released in Java 16 to simplify the creation of data-carrier classes.

## Key Concepts

- `record` provides a **concise syntax** for immutable data classes
- Auto-generates:
  - Constructor
  - Accessor methods (instead of traditional `getters`)
  - `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`
- Always `final` and immutable
- Cannot extend another class, but can implement interfaces

---

## Basic Syntax

```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {}
```

---

## Immutability

Once created, record instances cannot have their values changed. All fields are `private final`.

---

## Compact Constructor and Validation

You can validate input directly in a compact constructor:

```java
public record Product(String name, double price) {
    public Product {
        if (price < 0)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid price");
    }
}
```

---

## Methods in Records

Records can define methods like any normal class:

```java
public record Rectangle(double width, double height) {
    public double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}
```

---

## Records and Annotations

You can annotate record components:

```java
public record User(@NotNull String username, int level) {}
```

## When to Use Records?

* For DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
* As immutable API response models
* When using objects as map keys
* For simple data encapsulation
