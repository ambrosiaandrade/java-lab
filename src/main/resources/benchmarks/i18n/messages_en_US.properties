exercise1=Measure the execution time of a loop summing numbers from 1 to 1,000,000 using System.nanoTime().
exercise2=Create a generic method that accepts a Runnable and measures its execution time in milliseconds.
exercise3=Compare execution time of string concatenation using + operator versus StringBuilder.
exercise4=Implement memory usage measurement before and after creating a list of 1 million integers.
exercise5=Write a benchmark that runs two versions of a method (e.g., iterative vs recursive Fibonacci) and compares their execution times.
exercise6=Use Thread.sleep() to simulate a task and measure the time using System.currentTimeMillis().
exercise7=Set up and create a simple benchmark using JMH to measure the speed of a method calculating square roots.
exercise8=Add manual “warm-up” runs to exercise 7 to exclude initial executions from timing.
exercise9=Analyze and explain why benchmark results may vary between executions.
exercise10=Create a benchmark to measure the performance difference between using ArrayList and LinkedList inserting 10,000 elements.
